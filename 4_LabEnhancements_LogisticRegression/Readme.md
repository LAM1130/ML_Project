# Logistic Regression Lab Enhancements

## Overview
This repository contains an enhanced version of the Logistic Regression lab. The improvements aim to clarify concepts, introduce advanced topics, and demonstrate real-world applications.

## Objectives
- Clarify key concepts of Logistic Regression.
- Introduce advanced techniques like Regularization (L1 & L2).
- Provide visualizations for better understanding.
- Apply Logistic Regression to real-world datasets.
- Compare Logistic Regression with other classification models.
- Discuss advantages and disadvantages.

## Enhancements
- **Clarifications:** Added explanations on Logistic Regression and decision boundaries.
- **Advanced Concepts:** Introduced Regularization (Lasso & Ridge) to prevent overfitting.
- **Visualizations:** Included plots to illustrate model behavior.
- **Real-world Applications:** Used datasets to showcase practical applications.
- **Comparison of Methods:** Compared Logistic Regression with Decision Trees and SVMs.
- **Advantages & Disadvantages:** Discussed when to use Logistic Regression and its limitations.
