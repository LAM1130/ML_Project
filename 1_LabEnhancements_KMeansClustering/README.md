# K-Means Clustering - Lab Enhancement

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **K-Means Clustering** for data analysis and pattern recognition. The notebook explores clustering techniques using Python's machine learning libraries.

## Features
- Implementation of K-Means Clustering Algorithm
- Data visualization for cluster representation
- Evaluation of clustering performance
- Use of Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn

## Installation
To run this notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn notebook
```

## Usage
1. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Navigate to and open `LabEnhancement_KMeansClustering.ipynb`.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the clustering analysis.

## Description

## Understanding K-Means Clustering

### Key Concepts
K-Means is a widely used unsupervised learning algorithm for clustering. Here's how it works:
1. Randomly initialize cluster centroids.
2. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid based on a distance metric (usually Euclidean distance).
3. Recalculate the centroids as the mean of the points in each cluster.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 until the centroids stabilize (convergence).

### Challenges of K-Means
- **Initialization Sensitivity**: Poor initialization can lead to suboptimal clustering. K-Means++ is a common improvement.
- **Fixed Number of Clusters**: Requires prior knowledge of the number of clusters (k).
- **Sensitivity to Outliers**: Outliers can disproportionately influence centroids.
    

## Results
The notebook includes visualizations and insights derived from the clustering process.
