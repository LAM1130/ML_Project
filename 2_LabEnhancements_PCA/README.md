# Lab Enhancement PCA

## Overview
This project explores **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and its various applications in machine learning and data analysis. The notebook includes visualization techniques, component selection methods, and different PCA-based models.

## Features
- **PCA Visualization:**
  - **2D Scatter Plot**: When the number of principal components is 2
  - **3D Scatter Plot**: When the number of principal components is 3
- **Advanced PCA Concepts:**
  1. Determining the number of principal components:
     - Threshold value
     - Scree plot
     - Cross-validation
  2. PCA Feature Selection
  3. Kernel PCA
  4. Sparse PCA
- **Models Derived from PCA:**
  - Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR)
  - Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA)
  - Model comparison

## Dependencies
To run the notebook, install the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn plotly
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Lab Enhancement PCA.ipynb"
   ```
2. Run each cell sequentially to explore PCA concepts and visualizations.
3. Modify the parameters as needed to test different scenarios.

## Results
- The notebook provides visual representations of PCA-reduced data.
- It explores different techniques to determine the optimal number of principal components.
- Comparative analysis of PCA-based models is included.

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute by improving the visualizations, adding new PCA techniques, or optimizing the models.
